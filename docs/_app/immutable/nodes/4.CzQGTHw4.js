It lets developers instantly decode and read the <code>header</code> and <code>payload</code> of any JSON Web Token (JWT) directly in the browser — <em>without ever sending the token to a server</em>.</p> <p>Unlike online JWT debuggers that require you to paste tokens into third-party services, this tool runs 100% locally. Your sensitive tokens never leave your device, making it ideal for debugging authentication flows, inspecting access tokens, or teaching JWT concepts in a safe environment.</p> <h2>Why It Was Built</h2> <p>Most JWT tools on the web are convenient but risky. They transmit your token to remote servers, which can log, store, or even misuse it. For security-conscious developers, this is unacceptable — especially when working with production credentials or internal APIs.</p> <p>This viewer eliminates that risk by using only native browser APIs (<code>atob</code>, <code>JSON.parse</code>) to decode Base64Url segments. The signature is ignored (as intended for inspection), and no network requests are made after the initial page load.</p> <h3>Key Features</h3> <ul><li><strong>Instant Decoding</strong> – Paste any JWT, see header and payload instantly</li> <li><strong>Human-Readable Timestamps</strong> – <code>exp</code>, <code>iat</code>, <code>nbf</code> converted to UTC dates</li> <li><strong>Raw vs. Pretty View</strong> – Toggle between decoded JSON and original Base64Url</li> <li><strong>Copy to Clipboard</strong> – Export header or payload with one click</li> <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong> – Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop</li></ul> <h3>How It Works</h3> <p>When you paste a JWT like <code>eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...</code>, the app:</p> <ol><li>Splits the token by <code>.</code></li> <li>Decodes the first two segments using Base64Url rules</li> <li>Parses them as JSON</li> <li>Displays them with syntax-aware formatting</li></ol> <h2>Who Should Use It?</h2> <p>Frontend engineers verifying auth tokens, backend developers debugging OAuth flows, security auditors reviewing token claims, and educators teaching JWT structure — all benefit from a safe, offline-capable viewer.</p> <h2>FAQ</h2> <details><summary>Does it verify signatures?</summary> <p>No. Signature verification requires the secret key and is intentionally omitted for privacy and simplicity.</p></details> <details><summary>Can I use it offline?</summary> <p>Yes! After the first load, all assets can be cached. Add it as a PWA for full offline access.</p></details> <details><summary>Is the source code open?</summary> <p>Absolutely.
